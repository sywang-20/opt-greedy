# opt-greedy
### **Code for Nondominated Solution-based Multi-objective Evolutionary Greedy Algorithm**

1. greedy\
the code which introduces the evolutionary mechanism into the greedy algorithm
2. greedy-original\
the code which is the original greedy algorithm
3. nsga_baseline\
the NSGA-II code


### **Experiment design**

**evolutionary greedy**

synthetic case:
- at each step:
  1. produce 20 new plans for one plan
  2. keep 20 plans
   

**original greedy**

synthetic case:
- at each step:
    1. iterate all uncovered manholes
    2. keep 20 plans
